//! This is a sink that is used by path offsetting. This sink consumes both
//! `a` and `b` offsets of the path. The sink will be called for each figure
//! and is responsible for joining these paths. If the paths are not closed
//! then the sink must insert start cap, then join `b`, and then insert end
//! cap.
//!
//! The sink must also clean up the paths as this is not done by the offseter.
//! The reason is that in case the `a` path is the output path you can just
//! keep it and insert `b` path into it (clearing only `b` path after each
//! call).
