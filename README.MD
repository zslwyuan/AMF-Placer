## Introduction

AMF-Placer 2.0 is an open-source comprehensive timing-driven Analytical Mixed-size FPGA placer. It supports mixed-size placement of heterogeneous resources (e.g., LUT/FF/LUTRAM/MUX/CARRY/DSP/BRAM) on FPGA. To speed up the convergence and improve the timing quality of the placement,  standing upon the shoulders of AMF-Placer 1.0, AMF-Placer 2.0 is equipped with a series of new techniques for timing optimization, including an effective regression-based timing model, placement-blockage-aware anchor insertion, WNS-aware timing-driven quadratic placement, and sector-guided detailed placement. Based on a set of the latest large open-source benchmarks from various domains for Xilinx Ultrascale FPGAs, experimental results indicate that critical path delays realized by AMF-Placer 2.0 are averagely 2.2% and 0.59% higher than those achieved by commercial tool Xilinx Vivavo 2020.2 and 2021.2  respectively. Meanwhile, the average runtime of placement procedure of AMF-Placer 2.0 is 14% and 8.5% higher than Xilinx Vivavo 2020.2 and 2021.2 respectively. Although limited by the absence of the exact timing model of the device, the information of design hierarchy and accurate routing feedback, AMF-Placer 2.0 is the first open-source FPGA placer which can handle the timing-driven mixed-size placement of practical complex designs with various FPGA resources and achieves the comparable quality to the latest commercial tools. **Detailed Docygen-based documentation (e.g, introduction, usage, implementation and experimental results) can be accessed [here](https://zslwyuan.github.io/AMF-Placer/)**.


AMF-Placer 2.0 is the extension of AMF-Placer 1.0. AMF-Placer 1.0 is a wirelength-driven mixed-size FPGA placer equipped with a series of new techniques for wirelength optimization, cell spreading, packing, and legalization. Experimental results indicate that AMF-Placer can improve HPWL by 20.4%-89.3% and reduce runtime by 8.0%-84.2%, compared to the baseline. Furthermore, utilizing the parallelism of the proposed algorithms, with 8 threads, the placement procedure can be accelerated by 2.41x on average.

## Motivations

1. Just reinvent the wheel for fun, try to build a complete flow and reproduce/improve some state-of-art techniques in the latest papers.
2. Resolve some existing constraints in some previous works and consider more practical situations, like FPGA mixed-size placement with a series of optimization from the perspectives of timing, clocking, routability-aware and parallelism.
3. A beginner-friendly placement framework with clear hierarchy and detailed Doxygen-based documentation. We hope that it can lower the overhead for people who are also interested in this research area.
4. Currently, this framework is under development and it is still far from our goals and the practical demands, but we are happy to share our progress in this GitHub repository. If you have any questions/problems/suggestions, please contact feel free to contact us (Tingyuan LIANG, tliang@connect.ust.hk)
